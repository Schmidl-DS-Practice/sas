*  1) Notice that the INTCK function does not include the *;
*     optional method argument, so the default discrete   *;
*     method is used to calculate the number of weekly    *;
*     boundaries (ending each Saturday) between StartDate *;
*     and EndDate.                                        *;
*  2) Run the program and examine rows 8 and 9. Both      *;
*     storms were two days, but why are the values        *;
*     assigned to Weeks different?                        *;
*  3) Add 'c' as the fourth argument in the INTCK         *;
*     function to use the continuous method. Run the      *;
*     program. Are the values for Weeks in rows 8 and 9   *;
*     different?                                          *;
